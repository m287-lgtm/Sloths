Why Riga is the Ultimate European City Break
In November 2024, we hit pause on our everyday lives for a one-night escape to Riga, the capital of Latvia.

It turned out to be a brilliant decision. We found ourselves immersed in a city rich with fascinating history, beautiful architecture, and delicious food. Honestly, what could be better?

In this guide, weâ€™ll share why we think Riga deserves your attention â€“ and what we recommend you do while youâ€™re there!


The beautiful Old Town
Why Riga?
First and foremost, getting to Riga is super easy and affordable â€“ at least from London. We booked BA return flights for just Â£80. Bargain!

Even better, Riga Airport is only a 20-minute Bolt taxi from the city center, or a 45-minute bus ride. The taxi costs around â‚¬15, while the bus is a steal at â‚¬2.

For the history buffs out there, Riga is  superb. Latvia has been through a lot â€“ from German, Swedish, and Russian rule between 1200 and 1991 (with a brief period of independence between the World Wars). 

Now, onto the food â€“ Latvian cuisine is hearty and delicious, especially if youâ€™re a fan of meat, potatoes, and vegetables. Lucky for us, thatâ€™s right up our alley!

Lastly, we found the architecture to be absolutely charming, and the people to be lovely!

Sloth Suggestion: Rigaâ€™s nightlife is great if youâ€™re in the mood for it. ðŸ˜‰

Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 1: Arrival and Explore!
Start your journey by flying into Riga International Airport (RIX). After picking up your SIM card (although we could actually use our UK data allowance!), make your way to your accommodation. You have two main options:

Public Bus: An affordable choice at around â‚¬2. Check Google Maps for routes and schedules.
Bolt: A great Uber alternative. We used this to get back to the airport â€“ it cost around â‚¬15.
Accommodation in Riga
Surprisingly, Iâ€™ve never seen so many Radisson Blu hotels in one place â€“ I think I counted five in the city center! So, itâ€™s only fair that you stay in one.

We recommend the Radisson Blu Hotel Elizabete â€“ we paid Â£60 for the night and had a large, clean room in a fantastic location. The hotel also has a great gym and sauna!

Time to explore the city!
Once youâ€™re ready, grab something to eat (youâ€™ll probably be hungry by now). We highly recommend heading to Lido, a beloved Latvian buffet chain. There will be one near your accommodation. Lido is popular with locals, offering delicious and hearty food at great prices â€“ expect to pay around Â£8 for meat, vegetables, and sides. Delicious!

After eating, check out some local sites (but hold off on exploring the Old Town just yet). We suggest:

The stunning Riga Nativity of Christ Orthodox Cathedral.
Alberta Street in the city center â€“ known for its beautiful Art Nouveau architecture.
The area around the Freedom Monument during the day.
These stops will take a few hours, leading you perfectly to the 1800 free walking tour with Guru Walk. This tour will take you around the Old Town and was a fantastic way to have a local guide show us the area. (Not sponsored â€“ just a solid recommendation!).

The tour wraps up around 2000, making it the perfect time to head to one of Rigaâ€™s best restaurants â€“ Milda. The food here was incredible and, despite being in the Michelin Guide, it was very affordable. Starters, mains, and drinks set us back around Â£20 per person.

End the night with some drinks or, like we did, head back to the hotel for the sauna.


Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 2: Museums and Food
For your final day (it goes quickly, doesnâ€™t it?), start by visiting one of the excellent Martina bakeries scattered around Riga. Enjoy some delicious and affordable local pastries. ðŸ˜Š

Next, depending on your flight time, we suggest one of the following:

Visit the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia. This offers a fascinating insight into the often-overlooked and sobering history of Latvia. If you find this interesting, consider also visiting the KGB Museum for more historical depth.

Explore the massive Riga Central Market. This place is huge â€“ and full of life!

Thatâ€™s probably all the time youâ€™ll have, but if you loved Lidoâ€™s the first time, why not go back for lunch?

Finally, grab a taxi or hop on the bus back to the airport.
