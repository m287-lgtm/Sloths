Istanbul is a Turkish Delight (cringe)
What Makes Istanbul So Good?
Istanbul is where East meets West—in the best possible way. Straddling both Europe and Asia, it is clear from the moment you arrive that this is one of the World’s Great Cities. Like Cairo, Rome and Athens, Istanbul has a unique vibe born of centuries of empires, trade routes, and cultural exchange. This is what amazed us the most:

East Meets West
A single ferry ride (or metro!) takes you from Roman ruins and European cafés to colourful bazaars and Asian tea gardens. It’s one of the only places in the world where you can quite literally walk through centuries of history across two continents in one afternoon (this is as cool as it sounds). 

Iconic Buildings. Everywhere.
From the awesome Sultan Ahmet Mosque (the Blue Mosque) to the colossal domes of Hagia Sophia (once the world’s largest building!) and Süleymaniye, the city’s skyline is dotted with world-class monuments that just make Istanbul well, Istanbul. 

The Bosphorus
The waterway that splits the city is far more than just a pretty view. Take a ferry at any time of day (although sunset is the best!) and you’ll understand its magic—mosque silhouettes reflected in the (possibly golden) water, seagulls circling, and the call to prayer all around you.

Culinary Crossroads
Sample simit with strong black çay in the morning, feast on kebaps and mezes for lunch, and end with baklava. Istanbul’s food scene just awesome (and still pretty affordable!)

💡Sloth Tip: Don’t miss a mid-afternoon Turkish coffee!

What to Know Before Travelling to Istanbul
Here are some key facts to know before visiting:

Where It Is
Istanbul sits in north-western Turkey, split by the Bosphorus Strait. It’s not the capital (that’s Ankara), but it’s undoubtedly the cultural and historical heart of the country.

 When to Go                                                                                                                                                                                Spring (April–May) and autumn (September–October) offer the best weather and manageable crowds.                       Summers are hot and busy; winters are cool and often rainy (although we went in December and just had sun!)

Currency & Payments
The currency is the Turkish lira (₺). Credit cards are widely accepted, but cash is useful for ferries, market stalls, and smaller cafés. ATMs are plentiful in tourist areas.

Language Basics                                                                                                                                                                                  A few Turkish words go a long way:

“Merhaba” = hello
“Lütfen” = please
“Teşekkürler” = thank you
Most people in tourist districts speak English, but locals love it when you try Turkish.

Dress Code                                                                                                                                                                                                        When visiting mosques, modest clothing is a must:

Shoulders and knees covered.
Women should bring a headscarf (or borrow one at the entrance).
Elsewhere, comfortable clothing and good walking shoes are essential.

Istanbul’s Famous Cats                                                                                                                                                                 Yes, the cats are real. And they are everywhere. We have never been to a city that loves cats so much – everyone would stroke them, feed them and look after them! 

Sloth Suggestion: If you love cats, get some cat food and treat them!

The Sloth‑Approved 5‑Day Itinerary
Day 1: Arrival & Sultanahmet exploration

Day 2: East to West

Day 3: Sultanahmet Area

Day 4: Bosphorus & Beşiktaş

Day 5: Last Day


Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 1: Arrive & Settle In
You’ll touch down either at Istanbul Airport (IST) in Europe, or Sabiha Gökçen International Airport (SAW) in Asia – having been scammed by a taxi driver on this exact trip, I recommend hopping on the Havaist bus to Sultanahmet—about €5 or 200₺—for a stress-free transfer. Taxis tend to be pricier and, frankly, less predictable in traffic (find out about our experience here!).

For accommodation, I wholeheartedly recommend Zeyn Otel Istanbul – we paid around 1,500₺ (roughly £40 or $50) for a lovely double ensuite. Whilst the location is awesome, the best bit is the staff – so so caring (helped me get my scammed money back!).

We arrived just before 5 pm, dropped our luggage, and immediately set out to get our bearings. There’s something very memorable about that first evening stroll in Sultanahmet—Hagia Sophia’s dome looming overhead, the shops calling out to you, and hints of incense wafting from tiny courtyards. And of course the call to prayer. 

For dinner, head to Ortaklar Kebab Restaurant. It’s really close to the Blue Mosque, yet it feels tucked away from the tourist crowds. The kebabs here are great, and the prices are more reasonable than you’d expect in the heart of the Old City. Also, get the hummus!!


The Beautful Galetta Tower
Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 2: From West to East to West
Start your day early with a walking tour that takes you across to Asia – this is genuinely the best walking tour we have ever done, as it shows you the European side’s historic highlights before ferrying you across the Bosphorus to Üsküdar. The guide, Haktan, was a legend – knowledgeable, witty, and full of little anecdotes you won’t find in guidebooks.

Once you arrive on the Asian shore, grab lunch at one of the spots recommended by your guide—fresh pide or kebab, perhaps—then treat yourself to a traditional hamam. This Turkish bath ritual involves a steam session, an exfoliating scrub, and a soapy massage. We paid about 400₺ (around £12 or $15) at a local hamam in Üsküdar, and I can’t stress enough how rejuvenating it felt. Don’t forget your trunks! (Ask Haktan about this!)

After checking out Asia, we recommend taking the ferry back to Karakoy, in Europe. Make sure to try the famous fish sandwich sold right by the docks (4.8-star Google rating!). It’s a simple open-faced roll with charcoal-grilled mackerel, but trust me its delish.

As evening approaches, head deeper into Karaköy. If you love music, pop into Sala Müzik Karaköy, where they stock an amazing array of traditional Turkish and Middle Eastern instruments.

Find a spot by the water to watch the sun dip below the skyline of the Old City. We then considered climbing Galata Tower but balked at the high entrance fee (350₺, about $10). Instead, we settled into a nearby rooftop bar with equally stunning views and considerably more affordable drinks.


Gulls & the Bosphorus
Suggesed Sloth Itinerary - Day 3: Markets & Mosques
Begin with a morning wandering through the Grand Bazaar, one of the world’s oldest and largest covered markets. There are something like 4,000-plus shops here – bring your best haggling skills! 

After lunch, take a guided tour of the main Old City. Once again, this is done by Haktan – he will take you to the main sights around Hagia Sofia and the Blue Mosque. Top stuff. 

As night falls, make your way to Ararat Terrace Restaurant & Rooftop. The view of the Blue Mosque illuminated in the dusk light is nothing short of beautiful. And if you happen to be served by Sergio, be sure to pass along our regards—he’s a ledj.


The Blue Mosque
Suggested Sloth Itinerary - Day 3: Bosphorus & Besiktas
Wake up early and explore the Spice Bazaar, for all the saffron, sumac, and rose petals you could ever want. From there, catch a public ferry on the Şehir Hatları line—less than 15₺ (about $1) each way—to Emirgan. 

On arrival, go find Tarsusi Kebap Emirgan – this was the best kebab we had! Then go check out the lovely little town!

Return to Eminönü (on the ferry) and head to Beşiktaş for a football stadium tour. Even if you’re not a die-hard fan,this is a great way to learn about something extremely important in Istanbul! (Choose your team wisely!)

Round out the day at Hanzade Terrace Restaurant, back near HQ. Their fish dishes are some of the best in the city, and the view is great! We then headed back to Sergio for a final apple tea :). 


Hagia Sofia
Suggested Sloth Itinerary - Day 5: Farewell
On your final morning, venture off the beaten path: we recommend Chora Church in Edirnekapı, the cable-car ride to Pierre Loti Café for panoramic views of the Golden Horn, or the world famous Basilica Cistern.

For your last lunch, make your way to Fatih Belediyesi Çatladıkapı Sosyal Tesisleri. These municipal, subsidised restaurants serve delicious, budget-friendly meals—ours overlooked the Sea of Marmara. 

And then it is time to say goodbye… 


Thank you for reading our Istanbul itinerary. We had the best time ever on this trip, and i hope some of you readers are able to do this for yourselves.
