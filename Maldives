Maldives on a Budget: Our Crazy 36-Hour Layover
We have a habit of making our trips a little more… complicated than they need to be. As we were planning our 5-day adventure in Sri Lanka, a thought popped into Max’s head: “You know, the Maldives isn’t that far away.” And just like that, our already short trip got a whole lot crazier.

We decided to add a 36-hour, one-night layover on the local island of Thulusdhoo. Why? To prove that the Maldives can be more than just a luxury honeymoon destination. It can be a quick, budget-friendly, and ridiculously beautiful adventure. Was it a bit mad? Yes. Was it absolutely worth it? Hell yeah.

Here’s our step-by-step guide to spending a whirlwind 36 hours in the real Maldives.


The Beautiful Eagle Rays We Saw Whilst Snorkelling!
Why the Maldives?
Let’s be honest: when you think of the Maldives, you probably picture those eye-wateringly expensive overwater bungalows on private resort islands. For years, that was the only way for tourists to visit.

But here’s the game-changer: since 2009, the Maldivian government has allowed tourists to stay on inhabited local islands. This has opened up the country to a whole new world of travellers – people like us who crave adventure over extravagance.

By staying on a local island like Thulusdhoo, you get:

A Truly Authentic Experience: You get to see real Maldivian life, eat at local cafes, and interact with the community.

An Affordable Paradise: Guesthouses, local restaurants, and public ferries make a trip here a fraction of the cost of a private resort.

The Same Natural Beauty: You’re still surrounded by the same breathtaking turquoise water, white-sand beaches, and incredible marine life. You just don’t have the five-star price tag.

This is the side of the Maldives we wanted to see. We wanted to prove that you could experience this world-famous paradise on a backpacker’s budget and timeline.

Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 1: Sharks and Sunsets on Thulusdhoo
Our adventure began the moment we landed at Malé airport. The airport itself is incredible; you step outside the terminal and are immediately greeted by the most beautiful, crystal-clear water, with boats of all sizes zipping around, ready to whisk people away to the many islands.

Because we only had 36 hours, we opted for a slightly pricier $20 per person speedboat to get to Thulusdhoo quickly. Normally we’d take the longer, cheaper public ferry, but time was against us!

The moment we stepped onto the island, we were greeted by our transport: an electric golf buggy, which took us to our home for the night, the fantastic Azaya Beach Guesthouse.

After dropping our bags, hunger struck. We strolled over to a little spot called Hiyala Cafe for lunch, which served up some delicious and affordable local food. With our energy restored, it was time for a proper “Sloth” moment. We spent the afternoon chilling and snorkelling right off the main beach. The water was impossibly clear, and within minutes, Mia was squealing with excitement. We’d spotted an eagle ray gliding gracefully along in the depths and even a small shark darting through the shallows!

As the afternoon light began to soften, we made our way to the aptly named “Sunset Beach.” The view was every bit as magical as you’d imagine, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. After soaking it all in, we took a slow walk back through the sandy streets to Clamshell Restaurant for a fantastic dinner. It was the perfect, peaceful end to a wonderfully hectic first day on Thulusdhoo island.


Sting Rayyyys!
Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 2: Eagle Rays & Coca-Cola
We were up before the sun on our final day. Mia seized the opportunity to fly her mini drone, capturing incredible shots of the island as it woke up. The real highlight of the day, however, was our morning snorkelling tour.

Our first stop was a surreal experience. We found ourselves swimming amongst a huge group of stingrays. The second spot was even more breathtaking. Looking down into the deep blue, we counted about 26 majestic eagle rays soaring in formation below us. It was one of those moments that will honestly be with us forever.

Back on dry land, we decided to explore the island on foot. Thulusdhoo is famous for one slightly bizarre thing: it’s home to the world’s only Coca-Cola factory that uses desalinated water. We wandered over, and the friendly staff gave us a free, ice-cold Coke for our efforts!

For our final meal, we grabbed some delicious takeaway pizza from our guesthouse, found a nearby cafe for milkshakes, and had a perfect little picnic on the beach. Sat on a bean-bag underneath a palm tree, this was Max’s best ever beach experience (seriously!).

All too soon, it was 17:00, and we were waving goodbye to Thulusdhoo as our speedboat raced back to the airport for our onward flight to Sri Lanka (you can read about that adventure here!).


Coke Factory!
The Verdict: Was a 36-Hour Maldives Trip Worth It?
A flying visit, a blur of turquoise water and incredible wildlife. A 36-hour trip to the Maldives sounds impossible, but it left us with some of our favourite travel memories. It’s proof that this paradise isn’t just for week-long resort stays. If you’re short on time but big on adventure, a layover on a local island like Thulusdhoo is an unforgettable experience. We can’t recommend it enough.
