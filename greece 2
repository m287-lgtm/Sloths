Sloths in Santorini: The Ultimate Guide to this Legendary Island

Kalos Irthate (welcome) to Santorini or officially: Thira , the Greek island where beauty and romance
intertwine, with its breathtaking caldera views, iconic whitewashed architecture and stunning
volcanic black sand beaches. The island’s serene coastline contrasts with its fiery origin; landscapes
shaped by many volcanic eruptions, the last one being in 1950.

Adding to the island’s allure, Santorini is saturated with dreamy mythological tales. One legend
elucidates Santorini as a product of love; a mass of Aegean earth thrown into the ocean by
Euphemus, the son of the sea god Poseidon. The island was to be the birthplace of his child, with a
nymph… who also happened to be his niece? Luckily this is just a story, I guess the gods play by
different rules… but it certainly adds to the enchanting atmosphere of Santorini.

Today, Santorini is populated by 15,500 permanent residents and over 2 million tourists each year
looking to experience the romance, adventure, and culture haven for themselves.

All the more reason to read this guide and know how to avoid the crowds and get the most out of
your trip to Santorini!!


The Sloths in Oia, Santorini
Planning Your Santorini Trip
Choosing when to go is arguably the most important factor in shaping your trip to Santorini.

While not everyone has the luxury of travelling outside of peak season, avoiding the rush in July and August
and opting for the shoulder season in late May, June, or early September is likely the best option.

Travelling off-peak not only helps you avoid crowds but also saves you money on accommodation and transportation. You can still enjoy the glorious weather with temperatures ranging between 24-27 degrees. The sea temperatures remain relatively stable at around 22-23 degrees, except for May when it drops to an average of 18.5 degrees. Even in October, the weather can be pleasant, with temperatures hovering around 23 degrees in some years.

It is also important to stay in the right area of Santorini, as despite the size of the island- each village
is relatively varied. Additionally, if you choose to stay in between villages, it can be difficult to get
around the more rural parts of the island without hiring a car or quad bike.

There are 4 main settlements on the island: Fira, Firostefani, Imerovigli and Oia – all on the western part of the caldera overlooking the volcano, and each with a slightly different feel.

Oia
Oia is probably what you think of when asked what Santorini is like: luxurious restaurants and hotels,
high-end shopping, everything whitewashed and the best sunsets of your life. It is often considered
the prettiest town on Santorini. Oia, right in the north of the island, is a great place to stay if you’re
willing to pay, with many hotels available with private pools and a luxury feel. However, it’s important
to note that many hotels in Oia don’t actually have sunset views – especially if they face inwards
towards the caldera.

The best place to watch the sunset in Oia is near the old ruins of Byzantine castle, overlooking the churches of Agios Spyridonas and Anasteseos in the town centre.



My personal favourite part of Oia is Ammoudi Bay, accessible by road or on foot (300 rather uneven
steps down). Although the seafood restaurants down at Ammoudi Bay were way out of our budget, Max and I enjoyed the walk to the swimming spot just to the left of the bay. The bay also serves as a harbour for water taxis to Thirasia. Click here to visit our Thirasia page.

Fira and Firostefani
Fira, the capital of the island, is the largest of the towns. Similar to Oia, Fira has a healthy spread of
natural beauty and lavish shops and restaurants. However, what sets Fira apart from Oia is its
nightlife – an impressive arsenal of cocktail bars and several clubs, some of which offer live music and
views of the Caldera as you party the night away. By day, Fira’s many historic and picturesque landmarks make it the perfect place to take a photo: don’t miss the Church of the Three Bells.

However, due to its cosmopolitan nature, accommodation in Fira can be expensive and overcrowded. This is why we recommend Firostefani, which is technically a separate village, but a
short 3-minute bus ride (~2 euros) or 10-15 minute walk away from the hustle and bustle of Fira. For this reason, Firostefani is a quieter and more relaxing place to stay.

Imerovigli


Located 3.5km away from Fira, Imerovigli offers magnificent views of the caldera and the island. In addition to fine dining and bars, it is a must-visit location for its culture and historical sights.

Skaros Rock, a large pumice and pozzolana rock formation of volcanic origin, sits directly on the coast of Imerovigli, jutting into the Aegean. The Skaros rock is not only a dream destination for adventure hikers, but also a place of interest for history enthusiasts. Dating back to approximately 68,000 BC, Skaros rock once housed a 13th century fort and settlement that served as a major defense point and the old Venetian capital of the island due to its elevation. Although much of the architecture has since become ruins, tourists can still visit the beautiful Chapel of Theoskepasti, making the hike definitely worth it.

Imerovigli was our chosen location to stay – at the stunning Agia Irini hotel, which is situated in a relatively rural part of Imerovigli. Our stay at Agia Irini was delightful, with its incredible quiet coastal location, a pool overlooking the Aegean, 5-minute walk beachside access, and impeccable rooms and customer service. We were even treated to a glass of Agia Irini’s sweet wine on our arrival, earning the stay an extra sloth point for sure!

Transportation
However, it is important to note that staying in a rural location can be made more convenient by renting cars, scooters, or ATVs. Buses run between major towns, although it can be challenging to navigate the steep terrain between rural areas and the bus stops.

Therefore, our recommendation is to rent a vehicle.

Our preferred option is the quad bike, particularly for younger travellers. Requirements may vary, but typically a valid driving licence and drivers aged 18-21 years or older are necessary. However, this is subject to the rental shop’s policies. Rental prices usually start at 30 euros per day, and some rental shops offer delivery to your hotel.

Regarding other modes of transportation, there are several boat trips available.

These include day trips to Therasia and the hot springs on Nea Kameni, the volcanic island situated between Santorini and Therasia in the middle of the caldera. Nea Kameni, also known as the new burnt island, is famous for its waters rich in sulfur, iron, and manganese, which have earned it a reputation for having healing properties against many diseases and muscle stiffness.

Many of these trips depart from Athinios Port, while Ammoudi Bay also offers boat services to Therasia.

SLOTH SUGGESTION: Get the one-way trip from Ammoudi Bay to Therasia which costs only 1 euro!

Foodie Delights in Santorini
As is typical of Greece, you can expect to be spoiled with fresh seafood, tzatziki, olives, and traditional dishes like Souvlaki and Keftedes in Santorini.

Additionally, Santorini offers unique local delicacies such as fava, a flavoursome dip made of yellow split peas, white eggplant dishes, and local cheeses including Chlorotiri, a type of goat’s cheese, and Saganaki, a fried cheese favourite. However, our favourite meal was the cuttlefish ink pasta at the To Briki restaurant in Imerovigli, which earned a 10/10 for both scenery and food. Santorini offers restaurants to suit every budget without compromising on the quality of food.

For wine enthusiasts, Santorini offers a unique taste experience with its volcanic wines made from the Assyrtiko grape. This grape produces a delicious white wine with hints of lemon and honeysuckle, and a salty finish that complements its seaside location.

However, I cannot personally attest to the taste as the sloth palate is not quite yet that refined…



Keeping Costs in Check
As mentioned, our top tips for saving on your trip to Santorini are focused on accommodation.

Opt for local Airbnbs or more intimate hotels instead of luxurious ones; not only saving money but also provides a more authentic experience.
Choosing more affordable options during shoulder seasons in the outskirts of larger towns provides a budget-friendly stay and a more relaxing atmosphere – sunsets without the crowds.
Remember to bring toiletries such as sunscreen and aftersun, as they are often overpriced.
On that note, please note that the tap water is not potable. Therefore, it is important to purchase bottled water upon arrival. If your hotel room has a mini-fridge, we recommend buying several litre bottles of water and bringing a reusable bottle to refill and carry with you during the day.

All in all, the hype of Santorini is well deserved due to its rich mythological, historical, cultural, and scenic elements. Stay tuned for our upcoming articles, which will provide more details about other lesser-known islands that are just as excellent but receive less attention!
