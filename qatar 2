The Perfect 1 Night Layover in Qatar
Welcome to our guide to spending 24 hours in Doha, Qatar. Home to one of the worldâ€™s most popular (and best value?) airlines, Qatar Airways, it is becoming increasingly popular for travellers to connect through this global hub. Most, however, choose not to leave the airport gates â€“ a decision that I believe would result in you missing out on a lovely little country ðŸ™‚

Youâ€™ll have seen our little article (written mostly for fun) about getting the Qatari passport stamp (itâ€™s actually a disappointing sticker) on a 3 hour layover for those country counters out there â€“ written on our way to my favourite country â€“ the Sultanate of Oman. In August 2024, Max returned to Qatar as part of a layover to reach Vietnam (content loadingâ€¦). Here is what I would suggest you do!


Day 1: Through the Airport and to your Hotel!
On arrival, make your way through immigration (which will probably take a while!), collect your luggage and head out into the Qatari heat. Now it is time to make your way to your hotel. You have two main options:

1)Take an airport taxi. This does not include Uber, which does not offer airport pickup â€“ making this an expensive option.
2)Take the metro and combine with Uber (recommended).

But where to stay? Here are the Slothâ€™s suggested hotels in Doha (and, crucially, near the airport!)

Budget: Premier Inn Doha Airport. This is where I stayed. At around Â£35 per night, it was clean and perfectly located, close to the airport and the central souq (more on that later!). Bonus: Free airport shuttle at certain times and rated 4.7/5 on Google!

Mid-range: Double Tree by Hilton Doha â€“ Old Town. Also in a great location, this hotel has a 4.6/5 rating on Google. Rates start from Â£70.

Luxury: Souq Al Wakra Hotel Qatar â€“ a traditional hotel with a 4.9/5 rating on Google from 5.5k reviewsâ€¦ must be good! Rates start at Â£90.

As mentioned above, I would suggest taking the metro and an Uber from a nearby station if you are on a budget. For the Premier Inn, get off at Al Doha Al Jadeda (Metro day passes are under Â£1!) and then take an Uber to the hotel â€“ this will cost you around Â£2.

As you will probably be tired, take a nap to beat the heatâ€¦ best to do some sightseeing out of the sun!

Dinner and Souq Waqif
Given the limited time you are likely to have, I would suggest prioritising Souq Waqif, a wonderful old market that will give you a wonderful insight into the colours and smells of the Arab world.

Take the nearest metro from your hotel straight to Souq Waqif. Have a look around and enjoy shopping for souvenirs!

When you get hungry, head here â€“ Al QUDS Sweets & Restaurants. Priced at just 8QAR (Â£1.67), the shwarma here is some of the best I have had in the Middle East â€“ so good that I actually had two!

Afterwards, I would recommend taking a walk along the waterfront to take in the beautiful skyline before heading back to the hotel for a good nightâ€™s sleep.


Day 2 - Maybe a Museum Visit?
Depending on the time of your flight, you may have time to visit one of Dohaâ€™s excellent museums. These include:

1- Museum of Islamic Art (MIA (hehe)), which houses an extensive collection of Islamic art from around the world, including ceramics, textiles and manuscripts.

2- National Museum of Qatar, which highlights the history and culture of Qatar through interactive exhibits, relics and a beautiful garden.

If you need to get to the airport, just take either a hotel shuttle, an uber or the combined uber and metro ðŸ™‚


Thank you for reading our Qatar itinerary. We hope you enjoy your time there! Sloths of Love, Team Sloth <3
