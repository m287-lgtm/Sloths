A Whirlwind 6 Day Sri Lanka Itinerary (2025 Travel Guide)
Alright, let’s be honest. This itinerary is a bit ridiculous.

But if you’re short on annual leave and want to squeeze every last drop of adventure out of a trip, you’ve come to the right place. Welcome to the Official Sloths with Latitude Guide for Sri Lanka. With only 5 days of holiday available, we decided we should visit both the Maldives and Sri Lanka. So, having spent 36 wonderful hours in the Maldives, we hit up Sri Lanka…


Nelly!
Why Visit Sri Lanka in 2025?
Sri Lanka felt like a true privilege to visit. It was just wonderful: awesome food (Max had at least one curry a day, obviously), incredibly kind people, and amazing diversity in such a compact space.

One of the best things about visiting Sri Lanka is the sheer variety of experiences. One day we were scuba diving in the warm Indian Ocean, the next we were on a safari spotting elephants, and the day after that, we were breathing in cool mountain air in the famous tea country. This incredible mix of landscapes and activities is what makes Sri Lanka the perfect travel destination.

Understanding Sri Lanka’s Rich History
The history of Sri Lanka is as rich and complex as its landscape. For centuries, it was home to powerful ancient kingdoms and remains a cornerstone of Buddhist culture and history. From the 1500s, European powers arrived—first the Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British, who carpeted the highlands with the iconic tea plantations you see today.

However, the island’s more recent history is heavy. After independence in 1948, tensions between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority tragically erupted into a devastating Civil War that lasted nearly three decades, ending in 2009.

Is Sri Lanka Safe to Visit Today?
This is a question many travellers ask, and the answer is a resounding yes. While the war left deep scars, the feeling today is one of overwhelming warmth and optimism. The incredible resilience of the Sri Lankan people is a huge part of what makes a trip here so special.

Today, visitors will find that Sri Lanka is a safe, welcoming, and truly unforgettable place.

Sri Lanka Travel Tips: What to Know Before You Go
Before you jump on a plane, here are a few essential Sri Lanka travel tips for a smooth trip.

Currency: Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR). You’ll find ATMs in towns, but keep a stash of cash for small guesthouses, tuk-tuks, and all the street food!

Language: Sinhala and Tamil are the main languages, but honestly, everyone in the tourist spots speaks English. You’ll be fine.

Getting Around Sri Lanka: Look, for a trip this short, don’t faff around with local buses for the long legs. Hiring a driver for a day or two is a game-changer and won’t break the bank. For zipping around towns, use the PickMe app (it’s like Uber) to avoid getting ripped off by tuk-tuks. The train network is iconic and a must-do.

Connectivity: Just grab a Dialog SIM at the airport when you land. It’s dirt cheap and the data works pretty much everywhere.

Food: Be adventurous. Eat from the little hole-in-the-wall places. If it’s busy with locals, it’s gonna be good. Get the kottu roti. Trust us.

Sloth Suggested Itineray Day 1: Arrival in Colombo & Settling In
We landed at Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) late in the evening, so our priority was just to get some sleep. We skipped the trek into the city and checked into a wonderful, family-run homestay near the airport. It was perfect for a quick reset before the adventure began.

Sloth Suggestion: If you arrive during the day, you should definitely spend the afternoon exploring Colombo! Drop your bags and grab a tuk-tuk to see the Gangaramaya Temple, wander along the Galle Face Green at sunset, and dive into the chaos of the Pettah Market.


Hikkaduwa
Day 2: South to the Coast for Scuba in Hikkaduwa
After a good night’s sleep, it was time to hit the road. We organised a taxi to take us south to the coast. Our destination: Hikkaduwa. It’s a chilled-out beach town with a rep for great scuba diving in Sri Lanka. 

The diving was great and pretty affordable – in fact, Mia decided to complete her PADI Advanced Open Water here! Not as good vis etc as in the Malidives, but a really fun few dives. 

For dinner we found a good restaurant on the beach, where Max had a selection of delicious curries and a cold Lion beer. Fab. 

And then we found our wonderful guesthouse for the night.

Now it becomes a bit crazy…


Yala National Park
Suggesed Sloth Itinerary - Day 3: Yala National Park Safari and Arriving in Ella
The alarm went off at a stupid hour. 2 am. Today was a massive travel day, broken up by a safari in Yala National Park.

We’d found a driver on Get Your Guide who picked us up in the dead of night, drove us to Yala for a sunrise safari, and then promised to get us onwards (and upwards!) to Ella.

Yala is famous for having one of the highest densities of leopards in the world. And while we scanned the bushes like our lives depended on it, the leopards were clearly not in the mood for visitors. But it didn’t matter. The whole experience of rattling around in a jeep, seeing herds of elephants lumbering past and grumpy-looking crocodiles sunning themselves, was an epic part of our trip.

From there, the car started climbing. By evening, we were in the cool, misty mountain air of Ella. We checked into our guesthouse, run by this absolute legend of a lady who, in our experience, made the best fish curry in Sri Lanka. To recover from the long day, we treated ourselves to a traditional Ayurvedic massage and a super chilled-out evening yoga class. The perfect “sloth” moment.

(If the guesthouse is full, we also stayed here for one night which was lovelyyyy)


Breakfast in Ella
Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 4 Things to Do in Ella - Nine Arch Bridge & Little Adam's Peak
For your full day in Ella, three things are non-negotiable.

Morning: We trekked through lush tea fields to the iconic Nine Arch Bridge. We even managed to time it perfectly to see the famous blue train crawl across—a proper ‘we’re really in Sri Lanka’ moment. Feeling brave, we then tackled the Little Adam’s Peak hike. It sounds more dramatic than it is – it’s a pretty easy climb, and the payoff is insane 360-degree views of the surrounding valleys.

Afternoon: We joined a local cooking class. I’d love to say we were naturals, but we were definitely better at the eating part than the cooking part. It was a fun, hands-on experience though, and we left with a new appreciation for the skill that goes into a proper Sri Lankan feast.


Yoga with a View!
Suggested Sloth Itinerary - Day 5: The Famous Train to Kandy & Our Journey Home
You can’t visit Sri Lanka and not do this train ride. We were up early to catch the train from Ella to Kandy.

Sloth Suggestion: Book first-class tickets way in advance on the official Sri Lanka Railways website or a third-party site like 12Go Asia. It’s a 7-hour journey, and having a reserved seat is a godsend. Don’t worry, you can still go and dangle your feet out of the carriage doors for that classic photo.

The journey itself is the main attraction, chugging past a non-stop panorama of tea plantations, tiny villages, and smiling kids waving from the tracks. We arrived in Kandy in the afternoon, had a quick wander around the lake, and headed to a local street food market for dinner. It was awesome – different stalls cooking up all sorts of wonderful dishes for frankly insane prices.

And then… that was it for us. With our time up, we had to begin the long journey back to the airport for our flight home. But here’s what you should do instead.

Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 5: The One That Got Away - Sigiriya & The Real Journey Home
This is what you should do with the extra day we didn’t have. After waking up in Kandy, hire a driver for the 2.5-hour journey to Sigiriya. This place is a UNESCO World Heritage site and arguably Sri Lanka’s most incredible landmark.

The plan is simple: climb the 1,200 steps to the top of the ancient Sigiriya Rock Fortress, passing the famous frescoes and the giant lion paws carved into the stone. The views from the summit are meant to be on another level. After your climb, grab a final, victorious rice and curry before making the 4-hour drive to the airport.

(Don’t be us. This is the perfect way to end your Sri Lanka trip!)


Kandy
So there you have it, our chaotic but incredible 6-day sprint through Sri Lanka. It was a whirlwind, but we wouldn’t have traded it for anything. Have you ever tried to squeeze a massive country into a tiny amount of time? Let us know in the comments below!
