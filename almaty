3 Days in Almaty: Kazakhstan's Greatest City
Max here…I have just returned from my first trip to Central Asia – visiting both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan – and what a trip it was. This time I took my mum along (sorry Mia), and, thankfully, she loved the Stans! 

Whilst we also visited Astana (more on that rather ehm, weird city here), it was Almaty that we loved. Think leafy boulevards, grand Soviet-era architecture, bustling markets, quirky cafés, and – my fave bit – HUGE mountains sitting just 30 minutes away. It feels more European than you might expect, yet completely unique.

So, if you’re planning a short stay, here’s our suggested 3-day Almaty itinerary –  the perfect mix of culture, food, and mountain air.

Why Visit Almaty?
“Wait… Kazakhstan? Isn’t that where Borat is from?”

Very Nice, you are not wrong. Whilst I love Borat, I must admit that it has absolutely nothing to do with the real Kazakhstan. The reality? Almaty is modern, safe, clean, and super welcoming. English is spoken more than we expected, taxis cost next to nothing, and the city is full of life.

If you want a destination that surprises you, combines urban charm with wonderful nature, and isn’t (yet) swamped with tourists – Almaty is an excellent shout.

Kazakhstan is also Central Asia’s richest nation, so it provides a good starting point for those wishing to explore more of this awesome part of the world…

What to Know Before Visiting Kazakhstan...
Before you jet off to Almaty (or anywhere in Kazakhstan), here are a few handy things to know:

💰 Currency & Payments
The local currency is the Kazakhstani tenge (₸). ATMs are easy to find in the cities, and most restaurants, shops, and cafés take card payments. Still, it’s useful to have some cash for markets…

🛂 Visa Rules
Good news for most travellers – citizens of the UK, EU, US, and many other countries can enter visa-free for up to 30 days. Always check the latest requirements before you fly, but generally speaking, Kazakhstan is pretty easy when it comes to entry.

✈️ Flights
Almaty International Airport (ALA) is the main hub. There are direct connections to many major cities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, though not always daily. We flew in from Istanbul (via Astana!), which has multiple flights each day and makes for a great connection point (my fave city in Europe!)

🚖 Getting Around (Yandex Go is Your Best Friend)
Forget Uber – in Kazakhstan you need Yandex Go, the local ride-hailing app. It works just like Uber (cheap, reliable, cashless), and honestly, it’s damn good. A 20-minute journey across Almaty can cost less than £3.

Public transport also exists – buses, trams, and the tiny but beautiful metro – but for convenience, Yandex Go is solid.

👗 Culture & Etiquette
Kazakhstan is a Muslim-majority country, but it’s also very secular and cosmopolitan, especially in Almaty. Dress is generally European-style and relaxed. Just dress modestly if visiting mosques.

Kazakh people are famously hospitable, and a few Russian/Kazakh phrases go a long way, though younger people often speak some English.

Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 1: Arrival and Explore!
Hotel Check-In: We stayed at the Resident Hotel Gogol – affordable (£60 a night), central, and perfect for exploring on foot. We found the free breakfast from the cafe below the hotel great too – especially the millet porridge! (i also enjoyed this cafe for lunch).

Start your Almaty adventure with a visit to Zenkov Cathedral (also called the Wooden Cathedral) in Panfilov Park. Not only is it one of the tallest wooden buildings in the world, but it’s painted in bright pastel colors that make it look like something out of a fairytale. Mum loved this. 

Next stop: the Green Bazaar. This buzzing market is the heart of Almaty life, where you can buy everything from horse meat (very popular here!) to fresh fruit and spices. Even if you don’t plan on buying anything, it’s worth the wander. Bring cash, and your haggling skills! 

After that, we recommend hopping on the Almaty Metro. It’s small (only one line), but it’s beautifully designed and spotlessly clean. 

If you’ve got a couple of hours free in the afternoon, make your way to the Arasan Baths, one of the most famous Soviet-era spas in Central Asia. A mix of Russian, Finnish, and Turkish baths, we find such experiences to be a great cultural insight… just be prepared to go full traditional and join the locals as nature intended (i did not do this with my mother!).

Coffee Breaks & Dinner: Almaty has a surprisingly vibrant café culture. Throughout the day, pop into one of the many specialty coffee shops (Brewsell or Sensilyo are good picks). For dinner, head to Navat – an atmospheric Central Asian restaurant where you can try plov, lagman noodles, or (if you’re feeling adventurous) beshbarmak, the national dish of Kazakhstan. Featuring horse!


Zenkov Cathedral
Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 2: Into the Mountains
One of the best things about Almaty is how close the mountains are. A 30-minute drive takes you to Medeu, home to the world’s highest ice-skating rink. In Winter, make sure you skate – in summer it will be closed, but still cool to see. 

From there, take the cable car up to Shymbulak Ski Resort (summer return lift passes to the very top are aboout $15). In winter, it’s a proper ski destination, but year-round the views are spectacular. You can take another 2 cable cars up to over 3,000m – where you’ll be surrounded by jagged peaks and pure alpine air.

Have lunch at one of the mountain cafés, and enjoy the views! Most places here are clearly inspired by the Alps, which we loved. The Alps are superb, after all. In particular, we enjoyed some hot alcholic bevs from the modern hut found here, at 2800m!

Back down in Medeu, treat yourself to dinner at Auyl, a stylish restaurant that celebrates traditional Kazakh cuisine in a modern way. The interior is just amazing!

Sloth Suggestion: Once up in Shymbulak, take the chair lift to the next set of lifts, rather than the Combi 1 gondola. This is much more fun and will have a shorter queue!


3,200m!
Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 3: Relax in Almaty
On your final day, take it slow and enjoy Almaty’s relaxed side.

Start with a stroll through the city’s leafy streets and parks, grab a coffee, and enjoy the ex-soviet capital of Kazakhstan. Then head up to Kok Tobe Hill, reachable via cable car. At the top, you’ll find panoramic views over the city and mountains, a small amusement park, and even a monument to… The Beatles (yes, really).

If you’ve got more time, consider a side trip to Big Almaty Lake — one of the most photogenic spots in Kazakhstan – but note that it’s about an hour’s drive each way, so it might be tight on a 3-day trip. Alternatively, day trips to Charyn Canyon and the nearby lakes are very popular, but again – a lot of driving. Plus, we hear the lakes are better in Kyrgystan, anyway 😉

Finish your stay with a leisurely dinner back in the city – by now, you’ll know your favorite café or restaurant!

Or, like us, grab a Yandex and head to Kyrgystan for a proper adventure!


Thank you for reading our Istanbul itinerary. We had the best time ever on this trip, and i hope some of you readers are able to do this for yourselves. Sloths of Love, Team Sloth <3
