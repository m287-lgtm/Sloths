he Ultimate Guide to 2 Nights in Brunei Darussalam
As part of our 1-week journey across Borneo in August 2024, I made a perhaps slightly unusual decision ‚Äì to visit one of Southeast Asia‚Äôs most overlooked destinations: Brunei Darussalam. 

Why? Well, if im being honest it was initially to help me along my journey to visit every country on earth. But wow ‚Äì this place surprised me.

In this Sloth Travel Guide to Brunei, i‚Äôll walk you through how to make the most of 3 days in this intriguing, oil-rich nation (especially if you‚Äôre a Scuba Diver into wreck diving!). 


Why Visit Brunei?
Located on the island of Borneo, Brunei Darussalam is a tiny nation sandwiched within the Malaysian state of Sarawak. Best known for its insanely wealthy Royal family (the Sultan of Brunei has a car collection worth over $5 billion), this predominantly Muslim, oil producing nation is often dismissed as ‚Äúnot worth visiting‚Äù.

I categorically disagree with this belief. While it might not have the characteristics of other Southeast Asian hotspots, it offers something unique: an authentic, uncrowded experience of Malay-Islamic culture, and some of the world‚Äôs best wreck diving. 

Seriously.

üí° Sloth Suggestion: Brunei is the perfect country to visit looking to make their already adventurous Borneo itinerary even better! For those looking at ways to get from Malaysia (mainland and Sarawak) to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah and the Wildlife in the north, I honestly believe that missing out on Brunei would be a grave error.

VERY IMPORTANT: What to Be Aware of Before Visting Brunei
Before you visit Brunei, it‚Äôs essential to understand the country‚Äôs strict laws, Islamic traditions, and unique cultural norms. While Brunei is safe and welcoming, please make sure you the local laws and customs üôÇ

Brunei Is a Strict Islamic Country
Islam is the official religion of Brunei, and Sharia Law is in place. You must respect local customs, religion, and laws, especially during religious periods like Ramadan.

Avoid public displays of affection, criticism of the royal family, and immodest clothing ‚Äî especially in public buildings and religious sites. Drugs and Alchohol are also, of course, forbidden. 

For LGBTQ+ travellers, please be aware that same-sex relations and transgender expression are criminalised.

How to Get to Brunei (The Smart Way)
Sure, you can fly directly to Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei‚Äôs capital, but I wholeheartedly recommend the route we took‚Ä¶ (it is also cheaper, and comes with a convenient tour of the main sights‚Ä¶).

With that in mind, here is what we suggest you do:

‚úàÔ∏è Fly into Miri, Sarawak (MYY) ‚Äì We flew from Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines for just $40 / ¬£30! (Air Asia also fly this route for cheap!)
üöñ After arrival, grab a Bolt taxi to your accommodation in Miri (around $5 / ¬£4).

Where to Stay in Miri Before Crossing into Brunei
Miri is a small city with limited hotel options‚Äîbut we loved the Room Hotel. For just $15 a night, we got a clean, comfy room‚Äîdon‚Äôt be put off by the 4.1-star Google rating. Genuinely great (and I care about this stuff!).

If you‚Äôre arriving early enough, get dinner at Kebaya Story, rated 4.8 stars and just around the corner.

Then‚Ä¶ get an early night. Tomorrow‚Äôs a long day!

Itinerary
Day 1: Border Crossing, Local Culture & Homestay Vibes

Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 1: Brunei's Main Sights
Now, since Covid, there are no buses running between Miri and Brunei‚Äôs capital city, Bandar Seri Bagawan. Thus, we needed to get creative. 

An Affordable Private Tour Across the Border
Whilst searching online, I found a company known as FindMe Logistics, ran by the amazing Pauline. For just $40/¬£30 per person (we travelled as a pair), she picked us up in Miri, Malaysia and drove us into Brunei.

But there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶ included for the fee (which for a private 3 hour taxi was already pretty good!), she took us to all of Brunei‚Äôs main attractions along the way to our homestay. Unreal value (esp when a private Brunei tour from Viator etc is double this per person!)

What We Saw On the Way:
1) 1 Billionth Barrel Monument ‚Äì an interesting little monument dedicated, of course, to Brunei‚Äôs 1 Billionth Barrel of Oil.

2) Jerudong Park (where Michael Jackson once performed) and what has sometimes been described as one of the world‚Äôs only 7 Star hotels ‚Äì The Empire Hotel. This was a lovely little surprise, and the staff let us wander the grounds freely. 

3) Jame‚Äô Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque ‚Äì The main public Mosque in the country today, this mosque was built by the current Sultan in the 1990s to mark 25 years of his rule ‚Äì given he is the 29th Sultan, it features 29 beautiful gold domes!

Please remember to dress appropriately here (they will, however, provide you with robes to wear).

4) Istana Nurul Iman (The Sultan‚Äôs Palace) ‚Äì Unsurprisingly, the world‚Äôs biggest house (2000 bedrooms and 200 bathrooms!) cannot be visited, but this was a great opportunity for some photos in front of the gates. We even saw the Princess of Brunei leave in a rather nice Jag!

5) Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque ‚Äì In my opinion, this is the most beautiful mosque on earth. Built by the former Sultan in the 1950‚Äôs, the mosque blends grand Mughal-inspired desing ‚Äì built from Shanghai granite, Italian marbel, English stained glass and crystal, Saudi carpets and a gold-leaf dome ‚Äì with distinct Bruneian touches, including a 16-th century royal-barge replica floating in its artificial reflecting pool. Don‚Äôt miss the photo frame outside!

Once again, please remember to dress appropriately here (they will, however, provide you with robes to wear).

6) Kampong Ayer Boat Tour ‚Äì For the next stop, Pauline took us to the pier for a boat tour of the world‚Äôs largest floating city ‚Äì Kampong Ayer. We (or Pauline) negotiated with a local water taxi, and for about $10 he took all of us on a 30-minute ride up the river and past Istana Nurul Iman (the house!), and through Kampong Ayer. This was awesome, and we loved seeing the floating fire station, mosque, and schools!

7) Lunch by the Brunei River ‚Äì Finally, we went for some food at a local restaurant by the river. Here we ate Brunei‚Äôs national dish ‚Äì a starchy substance known as Ambuyat. This was, erm, not quite like eating Argentinian steak, but together with dried fish, it made for an interesting meal. Deffo worth experiencing!

Where to Stay in Brunei
As we were diving the next day, Pauline kindly dropped us off at our lovely little homestay ‚Äì Poni Homestay.

Accommodation in Brunei isn‚Äôt exactly plentiful, especially for those on a budget. Poni Homestay, however, was perfectly located for scuba, and was very affordable, costing just $30/¬£25 a night for a private room, with breakfast.

For those less concerned about their wallets, however, you could of course stay in the Empire Hotel ($200/night). For those wanting to be closer to the central sights, the Radisson Hotel ($120/night) also comes recommended. 

üí°Sloth Scoop: For those wanting a really unique stay, we hear good things about Kunyit 7 Lodge ‚Äì located in Kampong Ayer! Make sure to book ahead earlier though!

Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 2: Sloths go Scuba
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the sights from the previous day are wonderful. But the best thing you can do in Brunei is, so long as you have the qualifications, is Scuba Dive the AWESOME WW2 wrecks off the coast.            

We (dove?? dived?? dunno) went diving with an awesome company called Oceanic Quest. They are the ONLY 5 star PADI centre in Brunei ‚Äì Poni Divers don‚Äôt use PADI, hence why we went with Oceanic Quest. 

Diving Brunei's Wrecks:
For about $140 you will get three amazing dives ‚Äì picture huge Navy vessels with bullet casings etc‚Ä¶ Here are the dives we did:

1. Australian Wreck (Dutch SS De Klerk)
Don‚Äôt let the name fool you ‚Äî the Australian Wreck is actually a Dutch passenger cargo ship, the SS De Klerk, built in 1909. Scuttled by the Dutch during World War II to prevent capture, it was salvaged and repurposed by the Japanese, only to sink again in 1944 after hitting a Japanese mine.

Depth: Around 35 metres

Condition: Mostly intact, slightly tilted

Diving conditions: Low visibility, narrow passages, and honestly a pretty spooking ambience!

Historical note: Over 300 people lost their lives when the ship sank

 2. American Wreck (USS Salute) 
The American Wreck is the USS Salute, a World War II U.S. Navy minesweeper that sank in 1945 after striking a mine. The blast tore the ship in two, and its remains now sit upright on the seabed off Brunei‚Äôs coast.

Depth: Around 30 metres

Condition: Broken into two large sections

Notable sights: Ammunition, steel hull fragments, and thriving fish life

Marine life: Lionfish, snappers, and other reef species

3. Dolphin 88 Wreck
The Dolphin 88 is Brunei‚Äôs most recent shipwreck, a Malaysian cargo barge that sank during a storm in 2013. Unlike the war-era wrecks, this one is peaceful ‚Äî and perfect for less experienced divers.

Depth: 10 to 24 metres

Condition: Fully intact and safe to explore externally

Visibility: Generally excellent

Marine life: Bannerfish, boxfish, stonefish, snappers, coral growth
This is pretty advanced diving ‚Äì the weather was cloudy, there are oil rigs next to you, and there is low visibility‚Ä¶. but holy schmoly, was this fun.     

Use the rest of the day to relax ‚Äì either head back into the city, or why not check out the local beaches and sunset viewpoints? Just watch out for the crocs!

üí°Sloth Scoop: Yes, I am aware that we stayed at an accomodation owned by the diving school i do not recommend. Just keep it hush hush that you are diving with Oceanic! 


(Substitute) Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 2: Jungle
Not a diver? No worries. Brunei has some of the oldest tropical rainforests in the world.

Brunei's Top Nature Spots:
Ulu Temburong National Park ‚Äì 50,000 hectares of untouched jungle, this park is renowned globally for its exceptional biodiversity, and also preserves the heritage of Borneo‚Äôs indigenous longhouse communities, whose traditional ways of life are deeply rooted in the surrounding environment. Bare in mind that a tour here is around $120/¬£100, due to its location and wildness! Supposed to be lovely though.
Nearer to Bandar:
Damuan Recreational Park ‚Äì Peaceful walkways lined with neatly kept shrubs and sculptures, offering beautiful views of Istana Nurul Iman.
Tasek Lama Park ‚Äì A calming waterfall and elevated vantage points over Kampong Ayer.
Bukit Shahbandar Recreational Park ‚Äì 70 hectares of rolling hills and diverse forest trails, making it one of the most accessible rainforests in the country for outdoor enthusiasts.
To visit these places, please message Pauline from FindMe Logistics or check www.bruneitourism.com.

Prefer Culture?
Check out the:

Royal Regalia Museum ‚Äì Gold, gifts, and possessions from the Sultan‚Äôs life.
Kampong Ayer Cultural & Tourism Gallery ‚Äì Learn more about the ‚ÄúVenice of the East‚Äù.
 I also hear the Malayan Technology Museum and the Maritime Museum are worth checking out!

Sloths go Scuba!
Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 3: Bus to Kota Kinabulu
As part of our Borneo journey, we left Brunei after 2 nights. Our destination was Kota Kinabalu in Malaysian Sabah. Now, of course you could fly there‚Ä¶. but we say take the bus (for around $35/¬£28, from here).

Why? Its quite simple ‚Äì you will get 8 passport stamps! 

It is admittedly quite a long bus, but the geography of the region makes it an interesting journey‚Ä¶

Stamp 1: Exit Brunei

Stamp 2: Enter Malaysian Sarawak

Stamp 3: Exit Malaysian Sarawak

Stamp 4: Re-enter (!) Brunei

Stamp 5: Exit Brunei

Stamp 6: Re-entering Malaysian Sarawak

Stamp 7: Exit Malaysian Sarawak

Stamp 8: Entering Malaysian Sabah 

What an adventure! You may not agree, but I think that is quite good fun (for a bus journey!)
