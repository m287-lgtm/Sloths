The Ultimate Way to Speedrun Japan in 10 Days
Welcome to our report on our recent journey to the Land of the Rising Sun. Let me start by saying that this itinerary may not suit everyone – but we were able to find cheap domestic flights, and with only 10 days in Japan, it worked perfectly for us!


Miyajima Island
What to Know and Do Before Travelling to Japan
The days of Japan being the most alien place a Westerner can visit (according to James May at least) are, in our opinion, long gone.

Fear not – Japan in 2024 felt like a breeze to travel through. Since the recent Olympics and Rugby World Cup, along with increased global interest in visiting Japan, cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto have become much easier to navigate.

That doesn’t mean you should come unprepared, though, so here’s what we suggest organizing before your trip!

Do you need a JR Pass?
What used to be an almost guaranteed YES is no longer quite as straightforward due to recent price increases. To cut a long story short – unless you’re exploring the entirety of Japan in a short amount of time, it’s probably not worth it. For this itinerary, we recommend the JR Kansai-Hiroshima Pass, which allows travel between Hiroshima and Kyoto for a good price (around £90). This can be purchased once in Japan – just head to a JR station (like the one in Hiroshima for this guide) and reserve your train journeys sooner rather than later. If you do opt for the full JR Pass, be sure to purchase it before your arrival in Japan.

iPhone users – you’re in luck! (Android user here – we have it harder). With an iPhone, you can download some really useful apps. For example, add a Suica card to Apple Pay to pay for Japan’s public transport with ease. Android users will need to pay at the ticket machines with cash. And for the ramen-loving iPhone users out there – download Ramen Beast! This fantastic app shows you the best ramen joints wherever you are in Nippon.

Our Japanese Journey
Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 1: Welcome to Tokyo
Start your journey by flying into either Haneda or Narita Airports (we always recommend HND due to its closer proximity to central Tokyo). If you’re coming from Europe, you’ll likely land in the morning.

After collecting your SIM card or testing your eSIM (we paid £13 for 2GB a day), head to your accommodation. While you could take a taxi, Japan has some of the most expensive taxis in the world. We recommend using Google Maps to find the easiest route and opting for the metro or an airport bus. Haneda to central Tokyo (Shinjuku) will cost around $5 and take about an hour, while Narita to Shinjuku costs about $10 and takes just over 90 minutes.

Accommodation in Tokyo

Where should you stay in Tokyo? While we actually stayed in nearby Yokohama, here are the Sloth’s suggested hotels:

Budget Option: Citan Hostel (£25/night)
A new and highly-rated hostel in a central location – ideal for budget travelers. (4.5 stars on Google)

Mid-range Option: Asakusa Kaminarimon Takenoyado (£65/night)
Asakusa is a fantastic district, and this hotel is well-priced and consistently praised for its cleanliness. (4.6 stars on Google)

High-end Option: Intercontinental The Strings (£300/night)
Great location – and an Intercontinental is always a solid choice.

Money-No-Object Option: Aman Tokyo (£2000/night)
Incredibly expensive but considered one of the best hotels in the city. I won’t be trying it anytime soon, but let me know if you do!

Once you check in, we recommend taking a quick nap to help manage what will probably be some serious jet lag…

Once alive again, and if you’re feeling up for it, we suggest taking a gentle stroll around some of central Tokyo’s top attractions:

Shibuya Crossing – Probably the most famous crossing on earth, this is a must-see. Walk across with the hordes of people a few times, then head to the nearby Starbucks for a fantastic photo opportunity!

Meiji Jingu Temple – A beautiful Imperial Japanese temple that makes you forget you’re in the world’s largest city. It’s a peaceful escape right in the heart of Tokyo.

Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building (North or South)– Head to the top for incredible panoramic views of the city (and maybe to Fuji if the weather cooperates!) Plus it is freeeee!

You will probably be pretty tired here, so take it easy. There is still a long way to go!

Meiji Jingu Temple
Suggesed Sloth Itinerary Day 2: Outer Tokyo (Or Stay in Tokyo)
For Day 2, you have two options – explore the outskirts of Greater Tokyo (as we did) or stay in the city, where there’s still so much to see!

Option 1: Kamakura
If you’d like to experience more of Japan, head south to Kamakura – a charming city just an hour and a half from central Tokyo by train (around 1000 Yen/£10).

Kamakura feels like “proper Japan” – there’s a lovely market with fantastic food. We highly recommend trying the curry bread here!

But the real highlight of Kamakura is Hokoku-ji Temple. Home to a stunning bamboo forest (arguably better than the one in Kyoto!), this serene spot lets you enjoy green tea in a peaceful, tourist-free setting. It’s a must-visit.

If time allows, visit the Kotoku-in Buddha – although we’ll admit the Buddha in Nara is even more impressive!

Option 2: Stay in Tokyo
This itinerary includes two more nights in Tokyo at the end of your trip, but Tokyo is vast – so don’t worry if you choose to stay! Here are a couple of ideas:

Animal Café – Why not visit an animal café? They’re fun, and after speaking to the owners about their ethics, we felt comfortable supporting them.

Teamlabs – World-famous for a reason – even James May loved this immersive art experience.


Ramennnnn
Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 3: Time for Hiroshima
Day 3 is an important one – today you’ll visit the Atomic Bomb Dome in Hiroshima. In our opinion, this is a must-see due to the significance of the events that took place here.

Here’s what we suggest:

Wake up early to catch either a budget flight to Hiroshima Airport (we paid £60 for a JAL domestic flight) or take the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) from Tokyo to Hiroshima (around £100).
If you flew, take the public bus to Hiroshima Station. It takes about 45 minutes and costs around £10.
If you took the train, you’ll already arrive at Hiroshima Station.
Once there, make sure to redeem your Kansai-Hiroshima JR Pass and book the necessary trains for tomorrow at the JR Pass counter. Don’t forget to reserve:

A train to Himeji of your choosing (we suggest the 0956 Sanyo Shinkansen) 
CRUCIALLY, the 13:25 Hamakaze train from Himeji to Kinosaki Onsen, and the 0933 Kounotori from Kinosaki to Osaka
Next, take the bus to your accommodation. We stayed at Hostel Mallika – an affordable capsule hotel. At £13 a night, it wasn’t the best hotel ever, but it was great value and just a 5-minute walk from the Peace Park.

Assuming you arrive around lunchtime, here’s what we recommend for the afternoon:

Visit the Hiroshima Peace Museum. This is essential, and we’ll let the city tell its story – not us.

Afterward, visit the stunning Miyajima Island. Home to one of Japan’s most iconic views – the Itsukushima Shrine – it’s a must-see. Use your JR Pass to go to the Miyajimaguchi ferry terminal, then take the ferry and spend a few peaceful hours exploring this beautiful island. Make sure to try the local grilled Oysters!

Back on the mainland, head to an Okonomiyaki restaurant for dinner – Hiroshima’s famous specialty!

After a full and meaningful day, get a good night’s rest – you’ve earned it.


Atomic Bomb Dome, Hiroshima
Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 4: Onsen Time
You’re in for another incredible day…

Start your morning early with a convenience store breakfast in Peace Memorial Park. It’s a peaceful way to begin the day and allows you to pay your respects to the people of Hiroshima. Once you’re ready, head to the train station – we recommend catching the 09:56 Sanyo Shinkansen to Himeji.

On arrival in Himeji, you’ll be greeted by the sight of a towering castle. Make your way there, but stop for lunch here first – and treat yourself to an affordable stick of A5 Kobe beef. Hands down, this was the best food I’ve ever eaten (so good I had it twice!). Trust me, this is the real deal. 

We didn’t go inside the castle due to time constraints, but if you’re keen, you could probably squeeze it in – just don’t miss that train!

Now, about that train – make sure you catch the Hamakaze train to Kinosaki Onsen (remember the trains will not wait for you in Japan!). You’ll arrive around 15:00, which is perfect. From the station, head straight to your hotel. I highly recommend ‘Kinosaki Knot’ for an affordable ryokan experience. At just £60 a night, this was one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in, thanks to the incredible service and unique charm.

So, why Kinosaki Onsen?
It’s not on the usual tourist trail, but if you want to experience authentic Japan, there’s no better place than an onsen town. Kinosaki is tattoo-friendly and incredibly welcoming. Rent traditional dress and an onsen pass from your hotel, then spend the afternoon and evening hopping between different hot springs, relaxing, and unwinding. You can even visit local restaurants in your yukata (bathing robes).

A heads-up – this is a nude experience, but men and women bathe separately (unlike in countries like Germany).

Note: If you’re not comfortable with onsens, consider spending more time in Hiroshima, Himeji, Osaka, or Kyoto. But trust us – Kinosaki is amazing.


Kinosaki Onsen
Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 5: Bowing Deers and Wild Nights
Today is all about blending history with nightlife.

Start your day early to catch the 09:33 train from Kinosaki to Osaka. Once you arrive, store your luggage in the station’s easy-to-use lockers. Then, grab something to eat – you’re in Japan’s food capital. (Ramenbeast is your friend here!)

After refueling, hop on a train to Nara.

In Nara, we recommend:

Visiting the massive Todaiji Temple and its impressive Buddha.
Bowing to the deer in Nara Park. They bow back – it’s adorable.
Trying fresh mochi. (Full disclosure – Max wasn’t a fan, but you might love it.)
If time allows, explore the many temples and shrines scattered around the city.
When you’re done, head back to Osaka, grab your luggage, and check into your accommodation. We stayed at The Hive Hostel – simple but super clean. At £20 a night for a dorm bed, it’s great value, even with the larger dorm rooms.

Evening – Time for Osaka’s nightlife!
The only place to go is Dotonbori. It’s packed with food stalls – just follow your nose and eat whatever looks delicious!

If you’re not ready to call it a night, Round1 Stadium is an epic arcade with seven floors of games, sports, and entertainment. We spent hours here, and it was fantastic.

Sloth Suggestion: Round1 is even more fun after a few beers – if that’s your vibe.


Todaiji Temple, Nara
Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 6: Day off in Kyoto
Good news for those nursing a hangover – today’s main task is simple: take a 30-minute train to Kyoto.

If that’s all you can handle, no judgment.

For the rest of you (either better drinkers or just more sensible), today is about exploring what many consider Japan’s best city.

First, drop your bags at your accommodation. Kyoto has incredible ryokans, but if you’re on a budget, we recommend Peace Hostel Kyoto. A double room costs £36, and it’s absolutely fantastic.

Once you’re ready, here’s the plan:

Visit the iconic Fushimi Inari Shrine – you know, the one with all the red torii gates! Follow the crowds up, but if you’re lucky (or accidentally adventurous, like us), you might find yourself alone on a quiet path. It’s a magical experience.
Stroll through Gion, Kyoto’s famous Geisha district. There’s plenty of traditional shopping to enjoy.
If time allows, explore another of Kyoto’s many stunning temples – you really can’t go wrong.
Take it easy and soak in the atmosphere – Kyoto has a way of slowing you down in the best way.


A View Over Kyoto
Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 7: Back to the capital
Today is your final day outside of Tokyo – but don’t worry, the journey back is easy.
Whether you opt for a quick flight or a 2-hour Shinkansen ride, you’ve got plenty of time to make the most of Kyoto.

So, how should you spend those precious hours?

Head to the insta-famous Arashiyama Bamboo Forest – it’s as beautiful as the photos suggest.
While you’re there, visit the snow monkeys at Iwatayama Monkey Park. Honestly, the monkeys were our favorite part of Kyoto – this is a must for animal lovers.
This will take a couple of hours, but if you find yourself with more time, consider:

Visiting more of Kyoto’s stunning temples.
Exploring the Kyoto Railway Museum – surprisingly fun, even if you’re not a train enthusiast.
Now it’s probably time to return to Tokyo.

Once back, check in to one of the hotels we mentioned earlier, and end your day with some great food.
If you haven’t yet, make sure to visit Ichiran for a unique, solo ramen experience. 


Arashiyama Bamboo Forest
Sloth Suggested Itinerary Day 8: Time to Go Home 🙁
Ah, rats – the time has come to head back to the airport.
Unless you’re lucky enough to have an evening flight, in which case, you get a few more hours to enjoy Tokyo!

For those with extra time, the world’s largest city is packed with things to do. 

But, don’t miss that flight!

Thank you for reading our Japan itinerary. We loved this trip, and are already planning our return for Feb 2025!

Sloths of Love, Team Sloth <3
