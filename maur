Why Visit Mauritius?
Mauritius might sound like one of those honeymoon-only destinations – and yeah, it can be that. But it’s also so much more. This island is packed with beautiful mountains and beaches, buzzing markets, creole culture, rare wildlife, world-class diving, and some lovely people. 

Historically, Mauritius is also fascinating – home to the legendary Dodo, this island was once separate to the large land mass of Pangea, meaning it developed a totally unique ecosystem. First discovered by Arab sailors, it remained uninhabited until the Dutch arrived in the 16th century, bringing with them sugarcane, deer… and unfortunately, the extinction of the Dodo. The Dutch abandoned it, the French colonised it, and then the British took control – all of which has left Mauritius with a rich blend of European, African, Indian, and Chinese influences. Today, this cultural melting pot makes the island unique – with a peaceful coexistence of many different religions and cultures – something that is best felt in the delicious food scene. 

And did we mention it’s actually affordable if you plan smart?

What to Know Before Travelling to Mauritius
Currency: Mauritian Rupee. ATMs are everywhere, and most places take card.

Language: English and French are both widely spoken, though Mauritian Creole is what you’ll hear most often.

Driving: You will want to rent a car. Public buses are an inefficient faff, especially with limited time. Just be aware they drive on the left!

Connectivity: You can buy a local SIM card at the airport – we paid about $17 for 200GB with Emtel for their tourist pack (this is obviously way too much data but so be it).

Food: A spicy mix of Indian, Creole, and French cuisine. Street food is cheap and incredible. (Get the dhal puri. Trust us.)


The northern beaches are superb....
Where to Stay in Mauritius
For this guide, we suggest exploring the whole island, and our itinerary shows this. However, I also appreciate that Mauritius is one of those places where you can just stay in the same place- if that is what you are after. As such, each coast offers something different, so here’s a quick guide:

East Coast – Best for Resorts & Peace
 
Budget: EvaZion – Family-run, peaceful, and right by a river (£50)

Mid-range: Tropical Attitude – Adults only, gorgeous decor, great food (£120)

Luxury: Shangri-La Le Touessrok – Pure honeymoon vibes (£400+)

Avoid the East in June-August due to the increased wind and rain!

West Coast – Best for Sunsets & Excursions
 
Budget/Mid-range: La Mini Casa (Airbnb) – Simple beachfront home, lovely host, immaculate views (£100) – More on this gem below…

Luxury: Maradiva Villas – Private pool villas with views for days (£500+)

South Coast – Best for Nature & Rugged Scenery
 
Budget: Kaz’alala – Cool guesthouse near Le Morne (£50)

Mid-range: Chalets Chamarel – Up in the hills with surreal views (£120)

Luxury: LUX Le Morne – Ridiculously beautiful. Think mountains-meet-beach (£400+)

Again, avoid the South Coast in June-August due to rain and wind!
North Coast – Best for Nightlife, Beaches, & Diving
 
Budget: Balynea AirBnB–This was a really lovely modern AirBnB with a great location (£80)

Mid-range: Bleu de Toi Boutique Guesthouse – Super chilled, great location (£135)

Luxury: Royal Palm Beachcomber – Probably the most iconic hotel in Mauritius (£600+)


Seven Coloured Earths
The Sloth‑Approved 7‑Day Itinerary
Day 1: Arrive and relax in the West
Day 2 & 3: Check out the South East
Day 4: Make your way up north
Day 5 & 6: Northern Scuba & Beaches
Day 7: Port Louis 
Days 8: East Coast Roadtrip to the Airport

Suggested Sloth Itinerary Day 1: Arrival & the West Coast
Land at MRU Airport, grab your bags, and head straight to the rental car counter. Honestly – a car is essential here. We hired a little Suzuki from a local company called AKD (recommended by our first AirBnB host) and all went well. 

From the airport, it’s a scenic 1 hour drive to La Mini Casa in Black River – a beachfront Airbnb that’s SO much better than any hotel. Simple? Yes. But the location is unreal. You’re literally ten metres from the sea (see the photo below!). For the four of us, this worked out to be £25 each a night – pretty damn good for what we got. 

You’ll probably be jetlagged and tired – so just check in, crack open a (local) Phoenix beer, and relax.

For dinner, we recommend a lovely Indian restaurant called Happy Rajah – I really loved the fish curry!!

Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 2: Charmarel Waterfalls, Seven Colours and Rum 
Today’s your first real taste of the island, and it’s a good one.

Morning: Head inland to a small mountain village named Chamarel. There are a few things to see here, but we recommened the following:

The Chamarel Waterfall – Mauritius’ tallest – surrounded by lush jungle and volcanic cliffs. It’s seriously impressive. This is also where i saw my first flying fox (fruit bat), now one of my fave animals.

The Seven Coloured Earths. This weird and wonderful natural formation looks like someone spilled pastel crayons across the sand. 

A Rum Tasting Tour: For those able to drink, the best thing you can do in Chamarel is tour the Rhumerie de Chamarel. For around £10 you get to learn all about the rum-making process, and best of all, you get to taste all of their rums! These are delicious, and you’ll definitely want to buy a bottle or two – or five (like we did lol). 

Afternoon / Evening: For the rest of the day, we recommend doing what probably brought you to Mauritius in the first place – chilling out on the beach. We loved La Morne Beach for its soft, white sand – however, if you are in La Mini Casa, we would suggest just staying at your private beach!

For food, we can recommend another local restaurant called Mi Cafe.


Chamarel Waterfall
Suggesed Sloth Itinerary - Day 3: Hike La Morne & Beach
For day 3, start early – because you’re climbing Le Morne Brabant, a UNESCO-listed mountain that is the most iconic landmark in Mauritius (see the top photo of this blog!). Historically, Le Morne is very important in Mauritus – in the 18th and early 19th centuries, runaway slaves – known as Maroons – sought refuge on this mountain, using its caves and rugged slopes to hide from colonial forces.

To get there, head to the official Le Morne trailhead, found here, which is just past the Le Morne Brabant Public Beach. There’s a small parking area at the base of the mountain. The trail is managed by the Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund, and as of now, access is free, but you’ll need to sign in at the gate.

The trail is about 3 to 4 hours round-trip, depending on your pace. The first half of the hike is moderate, winding through green vegetation with occasional views of the coastline. The second half, though – that’s where it gets intense. Think steep, rocky ascents, some scrambling, and exposed areas where you’ll need to use your hands. There are ropes and railings in the steepest sections, but be cautious – especially if you’re afraid of heights.

But no need to worry – it’s deffo doable, even if you’re not a pro hiker. My sister even climbed it completely barefoot (don’t try that), so you’ll make it up with the right kit.

At the summit, you will be greeted by absolutely jaw-dropping views of the turquoise lagoons and coral reefs below.

Afternoon: Time to cool off. Our top beaches nearby:

Le Morne Public Beach – calm, shallow water and kite surfers galore.

Tamarin Beach – quieter, nice for a stroll.

La Preneuse – soft sand and great for a picnic.


Expect views of the Reef like this!
Suggested Sloth Itinerary -Day 4: Head North
Today is more chill… its time to swap coastlines, as today you are leaving your accom and heading north…

In the Morning: Checkout, and stop at Flic-en-Flac, a laid-back beach town on the west coast. Here you will find long stretches of white sand, clear shallow water, and a lovely relaxed vibe. Flic-en-Flac is also a great place for boat tours or dolphin tours (but I am not sure about how ethical such dolphin tours are…). 

If it’s a Sunday, you’re in for a treat: locals set up BBQs under the casuarina trees, music fills the air, and the beach becomes one big picnic. This will give you a taste of real Mauritian weekend life.

In the Afternoon: After you’ve had your fill of beachy slow living, start the drive north – about 1 to 1.5 hours depending on where your Airbnb is. The drive is nice – taking you through sugarcane fields and little towns, eventually opening up to the more touristy but well-connected north coast.

Arrive at your accom – we stayed at this wonderful AirBnB: a clean, modern apartment just minutes from the beach. Everything you need is nearby: supermarkets, beach bars, diving centers, and nice restaurants.

This is a slow-paced day designed to just let you enjoy Mauritius! 


Taken by my drone over the "underwater waterfall"
Suggested Sloth Itinerary - Day 5 & 6: Scuba Diving, Beaches & Chillin'
For the next two days, we went diving and relaxing – and if you can, we suggest you do the same!

Mauritius has some of the best diving in the Indian Ocean – and Crystal Divers in Pereybere were amazing. 

We each did 4 dives, with the highlight being:

⚓ Wreck Dive – The Jabeda (Advanced Divers Only)

Our best dive was at the Jabeda, a purposely sunken fishing boat located just off the coast of Cap Malheureux. It’s now an artificial reef, and the marine life is thriving. The vibe underwater was eerie but peaceful – fish everywhere and that surreal sense of floating through a ghost ship. A must-do if you love wrecks or underwater photography.

🐢 Reef Dives – Turtles & even a Shark

The rest of the dives were just your typical fun dives – beautiful coral reefs near Coin de Mire (Gunner’s Quoin), where I even say a reef shark :). 

They were super professional, always put safety-first, and were great for all levels. Highly recommended. 

Now for the rest of the day…


Mauritian Scuba Sloths!
Afternoons = Beach Time
You will probably be tired after diving, so we suggest two slow beachy afternoons. The northern coastline has some truly lovely beaches, and these were out faves::

Pereybere Beach: Just steps from the dive shop. It’s small, calm, and perfect for swimming. The water is clear and flat, with local stalls right behind you selling fresh juice, fried snacks, and coconut water. 
Mont Choisy: A wide, sprawling beach that stretches forever. It’s lined with casuarina trees and palms, making it photogenic – and perfect for doing nothing.
Trou aux Biches: Another stunner, especially at sunset! 
Evenings in the North are very chill as well, and if you want you can find beach bars, grilled seafood shacks and even live music on the beaches. But if you do one thing…

💛 Sloth Suggestion: Chez Vassen Restaurant
You have to go here.

Chez Vassen is one of my fave restaurants in the world – cheap and delicious food, made better by the generosity of the staff – we were given free dishes, rum and beers, and treated like family. It was so good, we went back both nights! 


Pina Colada Time 😉
Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 7: Port Louis & Spa
Today, we say drive to the capital, Port Louis. This city is busy, hectic and chaotic, but well worth a bit of time. 

We recommend you check out the following:

Caudan Waterfront: This is the polished side of Port Louis — a seafront promenade with boutiques, cafés, and shaded benches overlooking the harbor. It’s a good entry point to the city before things get chaotic.

Central Market: Busy, chaotic, and great for picking up spices or souvenirs.

Street Food: Look out for Dholl Puri (Soft, warm flatbread stuffed with curry dahl), Gateaux Piments (Little spicy lentil fritters), Mine Frit (fried noodles), and Alouda: A local take on a milkshake made with sweet milk, basil seeds, agar jelly, and sometimes ice cream. 

And, if you have time, check out the Natural History Museum. The only reason? Inside you can learn all about the Dodo!
After that, reward yourself with a massage – the spa at Veranda Grand Baie is lovely, or check out Spa Cinq Mondes at Royal Palm if you’re splashing out.


Mauritius' food scene is awesome
Sloth Suggested Itinerary - Day 7: East Coast & Bye Bye
Our flight wasn’t until the evening, so we did a scenic road trip down the east coast on our way back to the airport. Notable stops:

Cap Malheureux Church – iconic red roof, Insta-famous.

Belle Mare Beach – crystal-clear water and very chill.

GRSE Waterfall – short detour, totally worth it.

Mahebourg – sleepy fishing town with a great local market and ocean views.

Drop off your car at the airport, cry a little, and board your flight home already planning your return.
